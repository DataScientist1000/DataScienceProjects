Understand the problem. We'll look at each variable and do a philosophical analysis about their meaning and importance for this problem.
Univariable study. We'll just focus on the dependent variable ('SalePrice') and try to know a little bit more about it.
Multivariate study. We'll try to understand how the dependent variable and independent variables relate.
Basic cleaning. We'll clean the dataset and handle the missing data, outliers and categorical variables.
Test assumptions. We'll check if our data meets the assumptions required by most multivariate techniques.


1. What can we expect?
In order to understand our data, we can look at each variable and try to understand their meaning and relevance to this problem. I know this is time-consuming, but it will give us the flavour of our dataset.

In order to have some discipline in our analysis, we can create an Excel spreadsheet with the following columns:

Variable - Variable name.
Type - Identification of the variables' type. There are two possible values for this field: 'numerical' or 'categorical'. By 'numerical' we mean variables for which the values are numbers, and by 'categorical' we mean variables for which the values are categories.
Segment - Identification of the variables' segment. We can define three possible segments: building, space or location. When we say 'building', we mean a variable that relates to the physical characteristics of the building (e.g. 'OverallQual'). When we say 'space', we mean a variable that reports space properties of the house (e.g. 'TotalBsmtSF'). Finally, when we say a 'location', we mean a variable that gives information about the place where the house is located (e.g. 'Neighborhood').
Expectation - Our expectation about the variable influence in 'SalePrice'. We can use a categorical scale with 'High', 'Medium' and 'Low' as possible values.
Conclusion - Our conclusions about the importance of the variable, after we give a quick look at the data. We can keep with the same categorical scale as in 'Expectation'.
Comments - Any general comments that occured to us.


I went through this process and concluded that the following variables can play an important role in this problem:

OverallQual (which is a variable that I don't like because I don't know how it was computed; a funny exercise would be to predict 'OverallQual' using all the other variables available).
YearBuilt.
TotalBsmtSF.
GrLivArea.

At first sight, there are two red colored squares that get my attention. 
The first one refers to the 'TotalBsmtSF' and '1stFlrSF' variables, and the second one refers to the 'GarageX' variables. Both cases show how significant the correlation is between these variables. Actually, this correlation is so strong that it can indicate a situation of multicollinearity. If we think about these variables, we can conclude that they give almost the same information so multicollinearity really occurs. Heatmaps are great to detect this kind of situations and in problems dominated by feature selection, like ours, they are an essential tool.

Another thing that got my attention was the 'SalePrice' correlations. 
We can see our well-known 'GrLivArea', 'TotalBsmtSF', and 'OverallQual' saying a big 'Hi!', but we can also see many other variables that should be taken into account. That's what we will do next.

According to our crystal ball, these are the variables most correlated with 'SalePrice'. My thoughts on this:

'OverallQual', 'GrLivArea' and 'TotalBsmtSF' are strongly correlated with 'SalePrice'. Check!
'GarageCars' and 'GarageArea' are also some of the most strongly correlated variables. However, as we discussed in the last sub-point, the number of cars that fit into the garage is a consequence of the garage area. 'GarageCars' and 'GarageArea' are like twin brothers. You'll never be able to distinguish them. Therefore, we just need one of these variables in our analysis (we can keep 'GarageCars' since its correlation with 'SalePrice' is higher).
'TotalBsmtSF' and '1stFloor' also seem to be twin brothers. We can keep 'TotalBsmtSF' just to say that our first guess was right (re-read 'So... What can we expect?').
'FullBath'?? Really?
'TotRmsAbvGrd' and 'GrLivArea', twin brothers again. Is this dataset from Chernobyl?
Ah... 'YearBuilt'... It seems that 'YearBuilt' is slightly correlated with 'SalePrice'. Honestly, it scares me to think about 'YearBuilt' because I start feeling that we should do a little bit of time-series analysis to get this right. I'll leave this as a homework for you.

lthough we already know some of the main figures, this mega scatter plot gives us a reasonable idea about variables relationships.

One of the figures we may find interesting is the one between 'TotalBsmtSF' and 'GrLiveArea'. In this figure we can see the dots drawing a linear line, which almost acts like a border. It totally makes sense that the majority of the dots stay below that line. Basement areas can be equal to the above ground living area, but it is not expected a basement area bigger than the above ground living area (unless you're trying to buy a bunker).

The plot concerning 'SalePrice' and 'YearBuilt' can also make us think. In the bottom of the 'dots cloud', we see what almost appears to be a shy exponential function (be creative). We can also see this same tendency in the upper limit of the 'dots cloud' (be even more creative). Also, notice how the set of dots regarding the last years tend to stay above this limit (I just wanted to say that prices are increasing faster now).

Ok, enough of Rorschach test for now. Let's move forward to what's missing: missing data!
"""
#4. Missing dataÂ¶
"""
How prevalent is the missing data?
Is missing data random or does it have a pattern?
The answer to these questions is important for practical reasons because missing data can imply a reduction of the sample size. This can prevent us from proceeding with the analysis. Moreover, from a substantive perspective, we need to ensure that the missing data process is not biased and hidding an inconvenient truth.

missing_data.head(20)

"""
We'll consider that when more than 15% of the data is missing, we should delete the corresponding variable and pretend it never existed. This means that we will not try any trick to fill the missing data in these cases. According to this, there is a set of variables (e.g. 'PoolQC', 'MiscFeature', 'Alley', etc.) that we should delete. The point is: will we miss this data? I don't think so. None of these variables seem to be very important, since most of them are not aspects in which we think about when buying a house (maybe that's the reason why data is missing?). Moreover, looking closer at the variables, we could say that variables like 'PoolQC', 'MiscFeature' and 'FireplaceQu' are strong candidates for outliers, so we'll be happy to delete them.

In what concerns the remaining cases, we can see that 'GarageX' variables have the same number of missing data. I bet missing data refers to the same set of observations (although I will not check it; it's just 5% and we should not spend 20 in5  problems). Since the most important information regarding garages is expressed by 'GarageCars' and considering that we are just talking about 5% of missing data, I'll delete the mentioned 'GarageX' variables. The same logic applies to 'BsmtX' variables.

Regarding 'MasVnrArea' and 'MasVnrType', we can consider that these variables are not essential. Furthermore, they have a strong correlation with 'YearBuilt' and 'OverallQual' which are already considered. Thus, we will not lose information if we delete 'MasVnrArea' and 'MasVnrType'.

Finally, we have one missing observation in 'Electrical'. Since it is just one observation, we'll delete this observation and keep the variable.

In summary, to handle missing data, we'll delete all the variables with missing data, except the variable 'Electrical'. In 'Electrical' we'll just delete the observation with missing data.

Out liars!
Outliers is also something that we should be aware of. Why? Because outliers can markedly affect our models and can be a valuable source of information, providing us insights about specific behaviours.

Outliers is a complex subject and it deserves more attention. Here, we'll just do a quick analysis through the standard deviation of 'SalePrice' and a set of scatter plots.

Univariate analysis
The primary concern here is to establish a threshold that defines an observation as an outlier. To do so, we'll standardize the data. In this context, data standardization means converting data values to have mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

How 'SalePrice' looks with her new clothes:

Low range values are similar and not too far from 0.
High range values are far from 0 and the 7.something values are really out of range.
For now, we'll not consider any of these values as an outlier but we should be careful with those two 7.something values.

Bivariate analysis
We already know the following scatter plots by heart. However, when we look to things from a new perspective, there's always something to discover. As Alan Kay said, 'a change in perspective is worth 80 IQ points'.

The two values with bigger 'GrLivArea' seem strange and they are not following the crowd. We can speculate why this is happening. Maybe they refer to agricultural area and that could explain the low price. I'm not sure about this but I'm quite confident that these two points are not representative of the typical case. Therefore, we'll define them as outliers and delete them.
The two observations in the top of the plot are those 7.something observations that we said we should be careful about. They look like two special cases, however they seem to be following the trend. For that reason, we will keep them.
